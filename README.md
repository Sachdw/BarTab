This is a mobile project designed to help users keep track of their alcohol intake over time.

It is designed to try to make the process of logging drinks as simple as possible for users by enabling a functionality which allows users to store the drinks that they have most frequently in a "Quick menu", so they can log their drink in two button presses.

The app is built in SwiftUI with a Firestore database. The database also stores information about common drinks including alcohol content, to save users time in logging drinks which are not stored in their quick menu.

The design of the app was based on user research consisting of semi-structured interviews and surveys which revealed that users tend to drink the same few beverages in a single sitting occasionally trying something new.

The project is still in its prototype stage.
